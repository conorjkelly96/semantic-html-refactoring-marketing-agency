# Marketing Agency Website : Semantic Refactoring

## About the project

The exercise undertaken in this repository was to refactor the HTML and CSS code previously used to build the 'Horiseon' website. The original version lacked the used of semantic elements within the HTML code, likewise the CSS required some simplification by removing duplicates and restructuring some of the original HTML class structure to ensure a concise and clean solution. The goal of this exercise is to ensure Horieseon's website is optimized for search engines and increases accessibility.

## Original Website

## Solution Overview

### HTML Code Refactoring

The original Horiseon website contained no semantic HTML syntax. Firstly, I restructured the HTML code to contain more semantic syntax.

The code below is an example of the original source code:

```
var add2 = function(number) {
  return number + 2;
}
```
